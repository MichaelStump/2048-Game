# 2048-Game
A variation and recreation of the popular 2013 game 2048, involving combining tiles of 2 and 4 with alike tiles on a 4x4 grid to eventually reach the number 2048.

TwentyFortyEight.java runs the main method of the code and initiates the game.
Board.java contains the primary logic of the code that governs how the tiles move around the grid.
Frame.java contains most of the code that runs the visual appearance of the game (e.g. the color, frame, text, font, etc.).
